               <u> <h1 id="one">HTML</h1></u>
                <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.</p>
                <u><h1 id="two">Markup</h1></u>
                <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 & h2, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>

<u><h1 id="four">Elements</h1></u>
<p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: <p>.[73][better source needed]

    In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"<p></p> and "end tag". The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
    
    Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
