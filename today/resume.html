        PRIVACY-PRESERVING ELECTRONICS TICKET SCHEME WITH 
        ATTRIBUTE-BASED CREDENTIALS -                                 
        JUNE’24’- NOV’24’ <br>
        Users accessing services are often required to provide personal information, for 
        example, age, profession and location, in order to satisfy access polices. This 
        personal information is evident in the application of e-ticketing where discounted 
        access is granted to visitor attractions or transport services if users satisfy policies 
        related to their age or disability or other defined over attributes. We propose a 
        privacy preserving electronic ticket scheme using attribute-based credentials to 
        protect users' privacy.<br>
